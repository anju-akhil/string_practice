# Strings are Arrays
# Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode 
# characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with 
# a length of Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.


a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
